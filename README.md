# **JavaScript Knowledge Revision**

I’m taking this challenge to **revise and strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals**.
Although the original challenge spans **30 days**, my goal is to **compress the entire schedule** and complete it as efficiently as possible.

This space will act as a record of my progress, a place to track completed tasks, and a hub for all challenge-related code and notes.
